# ansible-collection-test
Messing about by creating a custom collection of stuff that does mostly nothing useful.

I used this to create the collection skeleton:
```
# init the directory
ansible-galaxy collection init aseriesofdarkcaves.ansible_collection_test
```

Then I read through [this](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/dev_guide/developing_collections.html).

I really don't know what the deal is with the various versions of Ansible floating about.
I suppose I figure it out eventually...
